# Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" alt="hello" style="width:40px;"/> I'm LostSoul and this is my digital garden!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I study computer science and live a simple student life. Here I will be writing about my days, classes, events. I'll be sharing what I have learned, what I want to learn and you'll be able to see if my knowlage grows... or not! I gladly discuss my mistakes and ways I approach learning. You'll be also subjected to my music tastes and gaming experiences! </p>
All the "branches"  in this garden are listed below. Have fun! <br>

## [[University-Studies]]
I study computer science, profile: Computer games design.<br>
this branch connect all the notes I write about my lectures, and what I learn in classes. I share my exercises and how i go about the solutions... or how I can't find a solution :D See my path to finishing University!
## [[Self Learning]]
That branch is for a notes I do when i'm self-learning something that isn't required from me in university, like another coding language, or concepts that aren't presented in classes. Like this Digital garden! 
## [[Games]]
Here you can learn my thoughts about games I play, my opinions and my rage quits! It'll probably be mostly about Doom series beacuse, as my classmates said: <br>
I'm a Doom fanatic! ðŸ˜ˆ
## [[Daily Struggles]]
Here's the branch where I keep notes of off-topic stuff.
## [[Music]]
Wanna know my taste in music? You don't need to look any further!
